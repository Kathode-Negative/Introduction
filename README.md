- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kathode-Negative
I'm interested in mainly computer graphics and GameDesign but sometimes stray into the deeper waters of Data Management and AI.

Currently I am just kind of vibing... just finished a work on fractal generation and am currently working on a 4D perspective Renderer implemented in Java.

I'm not really interested in collabs at the moment but if you like my work keep me in your RAM for a while.
